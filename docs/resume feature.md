I initially wanted the resume feature to enable the user to aggregate all their experience and skills from zettels, and then easily select which portions they want to include to be able to tailor their resume based off the job description of the job they are applying for.

The problem is that I'm not sure if this abstraction is worth making, as a similar level of customization can be achieved using a simple word/google doc. I'm not sure that this feature would provide any speedup over an external tool.

I may investigate implementing this feature in the future, but it doesn't seem to be worth implementing for the time being.
